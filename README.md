Comprehensive Resources for Cancer NGS Data Analysis ( CRCDA )

A simple repository to list different tools of NGS data analysis. The github version of this project includes only static pages.
The original version contains dynamic pages with search options. I will update this repository soon with new tools.

The site was deployed previously at http://bioinfo.au-kbc.org.in/ngs/ngshome.html . 
A simpler and static version of the website is available at https://manonanthini.github.io/crcda/
